VaaPin - Reindeer goes pinball.

The aim of this software is to allow remote maintenance
and even play of a pinball machine through a Vaadin user
interface.

This demonstrates real-time Internet of Things capability.

The pinball machine used is a REVENGE FROM MARS, built
in 1999 by Midway Manufacturing Company under the Bally label.
It was souped up with an unofficial firmware 1.8 that was
created by some ex-Midway employees for a private tournament;
and hardware-wise with an Ethernet network card.
