Notes for project VaaPin
========================

EPHEMERAL TCP/IP PORTS:
-----------------------

Pinball 2000 machines have a problem when communicating
with machines using TCP ports with a high number. Using
such a high-number TCP port when connecting as a client
is the norm for any modern TCP/IP implementation, such
as the ones on OSX, Windows or Linux.

The computers communicating with Pinball 2000 need to use
a low-numbered ephemeral port range.
Under Linux, this is achieved using
 echo "2048 4095" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range 
Note that you need to do this each time the system boots,
so be sure to add a line to a system startup script such
as /etc/rc.local so your range is always used.
Other machines must communicate through a gateway which
enforces this workaround.
Under Linux,
 /usr/bin/ncat -l -p 9999  -c "/bin/nc rfm.hacenet 23" &
 /usr/bin/ncat -l -p 10000 -c "/bin/nc rfm.hacenet 80" &
can be added to said rc.local -- this creates a server
socket on port 9999 on the Linux machine, forwarding any
incoming requests on port 9999 to telnet port 23 on the
pinball machine. This is the remote maintenance / debug
interface.
Similarly, incoming requests on port 10000 are forwarded
to port 80 on the pinball machine - this is the rudimentary
Pinball 2000 web-server, which serves the Pinball 2000 logo,
the game's name and location, an access counter and the high
scores list.
Note that /usr/bin/ncat is from http://nmap.org/ncat while
/bin/nc is from the netcat-openbsd package. There might or
not be away to achieve the same effect with only one of the
two programs.


THE CAMERA
----------
Many cameras use the RTSP protocol to support dropping frames
more easily. However, this does not work well with most HTML5
compatible browsers without resorting to plug-ins.
Therefore, I chose a TENVIS JPT3815W webcam. The camera's web
interface is on TCP port 7777, but if you append
'/videostream.cgi?user=admin&pwd=admin' to the webcam's URL,
then you can see the video stream itself. Of course, the user
name and password encoded in the URL refer to an unaltered
standard password; so if you changed your webcam's password,
adapt the URL appendix above.
You may want to use the camera's standard web interface to
control the camera tilt and adapt its resolution to match your
network upstream bandwidth.


COMPILING AND DEPLOYMENT
------------------------
Use a recent Eclipse, i.e. Mars with a recent Vaadin plugin
from the Eclipse marketplace. Export WAR file.
I tested this under a Tomcat8 installation on a Ubuntu 15.10
machine, deploying the *.war using the admin application
provided by the Ubuntu 'tomcat8-admin' package.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
All configuration is hard-coded in the Configuration.java file.
