EPHEMERAL TCP/IP PORTS:
Pinball 2000 machines hava a problem when communicating
with TCP boards with a high number.
Therefore, the machines communicating with them need to
use a ephemeral port range of up to TODO only.
Under Linux, this is achieved using
 echo "49152 65535" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range 
Note that you need to do this each time the system boots,
so be sure to add a line to a system startup script such
as /etc/rc.local so your range is always used.
Other machines must communicate through a gateway which
enforces this workaround.
